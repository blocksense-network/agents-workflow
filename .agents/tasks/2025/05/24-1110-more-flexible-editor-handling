in `test/test_start_task.rb`, the function `test_empty_file` currently
checks that creating a task with an empty description still results in
a branch being created.

This is not a desired behavior of the program. We should allow the user
to abort the task creation process by entering en empty message. Perhaps
we can make this work like git. We create a file with a single empty line
at the top, followed by an explanation, like this:

```

# Please write your task prompt above.
# Enter an empty prompt to abort the task creation process.
# Feel free to leave this comment in the file. It will be ignored.
```

The implementation can delete the precise comment message from the saved
file and then check wether the remaining lines consists entirely of whitespace.
This would indicate that the user doesn't want to proceed.

To make the program easier to use in non-interactive environments, we can
add additional options `--prompt=STRING` and `--prompt-file=FILE`.

Introduce these and make sure they are well tested. Don't remove the previous
tests with the fake editor, but rather test all possible ways to interact with
the program.

Don't duplicate code. Instead, make run_agent_task and the test routines more
parametric in order to handle all scenarios with the same set of assertions.
