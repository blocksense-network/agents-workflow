Create a test suite for the `agent-task` command.

All tests should be carried out separately for git, fossil, bzr and hg (the version
control systems supported by this project)

The test suite should work with temporary git repositories created within the file
system and it should test the following scenarios:

1) In a clear repository state, from a main branch, run `agent-task` and observe
   that the following is true:

   - a branch with the desired name was created.
   - A single commit was created in the branch, including the desired file with
     the task description was created in the .agents/tasks folder. There should
     be no other files in the commit.
   - the branch was pushed to the default remote
     (the remote should reside in another directory in the file system)
   - the working copy was switched back to the main brach after the `agent-task`
     execution completes.

Please note that `agent-task` will launch an editor. I suggest overriding the
EDITOR env variable with a simple program that writes the required task definition
and them immediately exists.

2) We want the above scenario to work in the same way when the working copy is dirty:

   - when there are staged files (for the version control systems where this exists)
   - when there aren't staged files

   The expected behavior is that the state of the working copy will be fully preserved
   after the execution of `agent-task` completes. All other tested properties, specified
   in 1) should hold.

3) Make sure that all edge cases are handled correctly when executing the EDITOR command:

   - The command may crash (non-zero exit code)
   - The user may save an empty file
   - The user might save a file with charaters that a not valid in a git branch name
   - The user might leave the "branch:" prefix or remove it.
   - The user might enter multiple spaces after the "branch:" prefix
     (these should be removed from the branch name)
   - The user may or may not enter a task description after the first line that indicates
     the branch.

The test suite should be executed with `just test`. Create a `Justfile` at the root of the
repo for this purpose.
