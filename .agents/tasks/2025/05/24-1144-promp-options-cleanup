Document the newly added `agent-task` options in the README

In `agent-task`, I don't like how the branch clean up in the abort
paths is duplicated twice. You can refactor the code to perform the
clean up in an ensure block. The clean up will be guarded by a variable
that will be "defused" in the happy path.

In the test modules, please add comments around the assertions that
clarify what is being tested in the assertion. Add an AGENTS.md file
in the test folder with suitable guidance for you, so you can always
explain your intentions behind the assertions in the tests in the future.
