After some testing, I've decided that specifying the branch name in the first line
in the created file (through the $EDITOR) is not convenient.

Instead, let's specify the branch name as an argument to the agent-task command.
This would also simplify the logic in the code and the test suite.

We don't have to sanitize the branch name anymore. We can produce an error if the
branch name entered by the user won't be valid in the current version control system.

Refactor the code and the test suite to achieve the desired behavior.
