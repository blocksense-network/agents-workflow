After manual testing, I've noticed that entering an invalid branch name still
opens the editor first, before reaching the stage where the branch creation
failure is reported. This is incovenient.

We should first create the branch (or fail) and only then launch the editor.
Futhermore, when the branch creation fails, we dispay a Ruby stack trace that
obscures the original error message from git (or any other VCS).

Instead, we should display only the original message from the VCS.
