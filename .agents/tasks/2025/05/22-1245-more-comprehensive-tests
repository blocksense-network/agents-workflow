In a previous task defined in .agents/tasks/2025/05/22-1031-create-test-suite
I instructed you to create a test suite that verifies that all tested properties
in the case of clean repo state apply to dirty repos as well.

The test suite you created doesn't do this. It doesn't have all assertions in the
dirty case.

To fix this issue, I propose a simple refactor:

Extract the assertions from test_clean_repo in a reusable function and test them
in the dirty working copy cases as well.
