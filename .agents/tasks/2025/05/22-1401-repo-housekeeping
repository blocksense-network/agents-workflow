Some tasks to improve the quality of this repo:

- Add an EditorConfig
- Add a Github CI (test on Linux, macOS and Windows)
- Add a just command for linting (modify AGENTS.md to mention it)
- Add a nix flake that exposes the agent-task command under the name `agent-task`
- Prepare `agent-task` for publishing as a Ruby gem as well
- Create a just task for publishing the gem
- Create a MAINTAINERS.md file that covers running the test suite, linting and publishing the Ruby gem (link it from the README)
