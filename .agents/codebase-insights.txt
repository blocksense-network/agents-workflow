# DevContainer Caching Strategy

## Cache Synchronization Commands
- `sync-cargo-caches`: Developer command to sync container caches with host system
- Automatically runs on container start via postStartCommand
- Can be run manually anytime to pick up new host packages

## Persistent Storage Volumes
- `agents-workflow-nix-store`: Persists Nix packages across container rebuilds
- `agents-workflow-cargo-cache`: Caches Rust/Cargo dependencies and build artifacts

Benefits:
- Faster package installation (no re-downloading)
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Incremental sync - only new packages are copied
- Manual control over when sync happens

## Cache Sync Behavior
- Nix substituters: Configured once at build time
- Cargo cache: Synced at container start and on-demand
- Efficient copying with COW/hard links when possible
- Graceful fallback when host caches unavailable

## API Key Management
Environment variables are propagated from host to container:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: Required for OpenAI Codex integration
- GITHUB_TOKEN: For GitHub API access and Copilot authentication
- Custom API keys can be added to containerEnv in devcontainer.json

Security considerations:
- Keys are not stored in container images
- Environment-based propagation is secure and flexible
- Keys are only available during container runtime

## Nix Flakes Configuration
- No channels configuration needed (removed .devcontainer/nix file)
- Flakes provide deterministic package management
- Experimental features enabled for full flake support

## Performance Optimizations
- Nix configured for multi-core builds (cores = 0, max-jobs = auto)
- Cargo cache persisted to avoid re-downloading crates
- Build tools pre-installed for native dependency compilation
