The VCSRepo helper abstracts Git, Mercurial, Bazaar and Fossil commands.
For the Fossil tests we initialise a repository file and open it directly as
the working copy.  The same directory is used for the "remote" in tests so
`fossil push` becomes a no-op but commits still appear in the repository file.
