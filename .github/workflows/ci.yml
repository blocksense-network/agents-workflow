# CI Policy: Always use just targets in CI workflows
# This ensures developers can run the exact same commands locally that CI uses,
# maintaining consistency and making local development match CI behavior.
#
# To run CI commands locally:
#   just fmt-rust          # Check code formatting
#   just lint-rust         # Run clippy linting
#   just check             # Check compilation
#   just build-cgroup-tests # Build test binaries
#   just test-rust-verbose # Run tests with verbose output
#   just build-sbx-helper-release # Build release binary
