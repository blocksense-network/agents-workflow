### Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the [TUI-PRD.md](TUI-PRD.md) functionality.

Goal: deliver a production-ready terminal-based dashboard for creating, monitoring, and managing agent coding sessions with seamless multiplexer integration, keyboard-driven workflows, and REST service connectivity.

**Current Status**: T2 completed, Testing Framework fully implemented with production-ready golden files, T3 ready
**Test Results**: 9 tests passing (layout rendering, MVVM integration, scenario execution, golden files with multi-line TUI visualization)
**Last Updated**: September 26, 2025

Total estimated timeline: 6-8 weeks (broken into major phases with parallel development tracks)

### Milestone Completion & Outstanding Tasks

Each milestone maintains an **outstanding tasks list** that tracks specific deliverables, bugs, and improvements. When milestones are completed, their sections are expanded with:

- Implementation details and architectural decisions
- References to key source files for diving into the implementation
- Test coverage reports and known limitations
- Integration points with other milestones/tracks

### TUI Feature Set

- **Multiplexer Integration**: Auto-attach to tmux/zellij/screen sessions with split-pane layouts
- **Keyboard-Driven UI**: Full keyboard navigation with contextual hotkeys and shortcuts
- **REST Service Backend**: Remote server connectivity for task creation and monitoring
- **Session Management**: Launch tasks directly into multiplexer windows with proper pane layout
- **Responsive Layout**: Fixed-height selectors with resizable description editor
- **Contextual Help**: Dynamic footer showing relevant shortcuts based on current UI state
- **Error Handling**: Inline validation messages and graceful error recovery

### Parallel Development Tracks

âœ… **Infrastructure established (T1-T2 completed)** - All development tracks can now proceed in parallel:

- **UI Components Track** âœ… **COMPLETED**: Full MVVM architecture with Ratatui widgets, state management, and keyboard navigation
- **REST Client Track** âœ… **COMPLETED**: Rust REST API client crate fully implemented and tested
- **Multiplexer Integration Track** ðŸ“‹ **READY**: tmux/zellij/screen abstraction layer (T3 Task Creation and Launch)
- **CLI Integration Track** âœ… **COMPLETED**: `aw tui` command with proper flag handling integrated
- **Testing Infrastructure Track** âœ… **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive TUI testing framework with scenario automation and interactive debugging

### Approach

- **Ratatui + Crossterm**: Modern Rust terminal UI framework with cross-platform terminal handling
- **REST Client Crate**: Dedicated `aw-rest-client` crate for API communication with mock server development
- **Multiplexer Abstraction**: Unified interface for tmux/zellij/screen with auto-detection and fallback
- **State-Driven UI**: Reactive UI updates based on REST API responses and user interactions
- **Mock-First Development**: Start with comprehensive REST client testing against mock server ([Mock Server README](../webui/mock-server/README.md))
- **Integration Testing**: Playwright-style terminal automation for comprehensive E2E coverage
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without advanced terminal features

**Mock Server Setup**: See [Mock Server README](../webui/mock-server/README.md) for instructions on starting the mock REST API server (`just webui-mock-server`) required for TUI development and testing.

- **Cross-platform Terminal Handling**: Different platforms handle terminals differently; mitigated by Crossterm abstraction and extensive testing
- **REST Client Maturity**: New crate needs thorough testing; mitigated by comprehensive API contract tests and mock server development

### Implementation Notes

- **Architecture Alignment**: TUI follows same patterns as WebUI (REST client, mock-first development, comprehensive testing)
- **Code Reuse**: REST client crate can be shared with other components (CLI tools, future UIs)
- **Testing Strategy**: Terminal automation framework enables reliable E2E testing of TUI interactions
