### Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the [TUI-PRD.md](TUI-PRD.md) functionality.

Goal: deliver a production-ready terminal-based dashboard for creating, monitoring, and managing agent coding sessions with seamless multiplexer integration, keyboard-driven workflows, and REST service connectivity.

**Current Status**: T3.3 kitty Support completed, Full multiplexer abstraction layer with tmux and kitty implementations ready
**Test Results**: 68 tests passing (18 comprehensive tmux multiplexer tests + 20 comprehensive kitty multiplexer tests + 15 TUI tests: layout rendering, MVVM integration, scenario execution, golden files with multi-line TUI visualization, CLI integration)
**Last Updated**: September 29, 2025

Total estimated timeline: 12-16 weeks (broken into major phases with parallel development tracks)

### Milestone Completion & Outstanding Tasks

Each milestone maintains an **outstanding tasks list** that tracks specific deliverables, bugs, and improvements. When milestones are completed, their sections are expanded with:

- Implementation details and architectural decisions
- References to key source files for diving into the implementation
- Test coverage reports and known limitations
- Integration points with other milestones/tracks

  - âœ… **Error handling**: Invalid sessions, panes, and command failures provide clear error messages and proper error propagation
  - âœ… **Visual regression testing**: 7 strategic golden snapshots capture actual tmux screen output (pane separators, status bars, command output) using expectrl + vt100 terminal emulation
  - âœ… **Thread safety**: Session isolation prevents interference between concurrent test executions using timestamp-based session names

- **Implementation Details**:

### Test strategy & tooling

- **Distributed Test Coverage**: Each milestone includes specific tests verifying its deliverables, preventing regressions and ensuring quality incrementally
- **Terminal Automation Testing**: Custom terminal automation framework for E2E TUI testing, similar to Playwright but for terminal UIs
- **Mock Server Development**: Start with full [REST-Service.md](REST-Service.md) mock implementation for isolated TUI development
- **Component Testing**: Unit tests for individual Ratatui widgets and REST client components
- **API Contract Testing**: Verify REST client behavior matches specifications and handles edge cases
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflows testing TUI against real REST service
- **Performance Testing**: Terminal rendering performance and real-time update latency measurements

### Deliverables

- Production-ready TUI application built with Ratatui + Crossterm
- Comprehensive REST client crate for API communication
- Full multiplexer abstraction layer with tmux/zellij/screen support
- Distributed test coverage across all milestones with CI integration
- Terminal automation test suite covering all user journeys
- Performance testing and optimization validation
- Binary packaging and distribution for multiple platforms
- Documentation and integration with broader AW ecosystem


### Risks & mitigations

- **Terminal Compatibility**: Wide variety of terminal emulators with different capabilities; mitigated by progressive enhancement and fallback to basic functionality
- **Multiplexer Complexity**: Each multiplexer has different APIs and behaviors; mitigated by abstraction layer with comprehensive testing
- **Real-time Performance**: SSE updates and UI rendering could impact responsiveness; mitigated by efficient rendering and update batching
- **Cross-platform Terminal Handling**: Different platforms handle terminals differently; mitigated by Crossterm abstraction and extensive testing
- **REST Client Maturity**: New crate needs thorough testing; mitigated by comprehensive API contract tests and mock server development

### Implementation Notes

- **Architecture Alignment**: TUI follows same patterns as WebUI (REST client, mock-first development, comprehensive testing)
- **Code Reuse**: REST client crate can be shared with other components (CLI tools, future UIs)
- **Testing Strategy**: Terminal automation framework enables reliable E2E testing of TUI interactions
- **User Experience**: Focus on keyboard-driven workflows optimized for terminal users
- **Integration Points**: TUI works seamlessly with WebUI for monitoring same sessions from different interfaces
