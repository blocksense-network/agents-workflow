### Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of the [WebUI-PRD.md](WebUI-PRD.md) functionality.

Goal: deliver a production-ready web-based dashboard for creating, monitoring, and managing agent coding sessions with real-time visibility, seamless IDE integration, and comprehensive governance controls.

**Current Status**: W1-W4 milestones complete, W4.5 in progress! All tests passing âœ…
**Test Results**: 46 total tests (43 passed, 3 skipped)
**Last Updated**: September 23, 2025

Total estimated timeline: 8-10 weeks (broken into major phases with parallel development tracks)

### Milestone Completion & Outstanding Tasks

Each milestone maintains an **outstanding tasks list** that tracks specific deliverables, bugs, and improvements. When milestones are completed, their sections are expanded with:

- Implementation details and architectural decisions
- References to key source files for diving into the implementation
- Test coverage reports and known limitations
- Integration points with other milestones/tracks

### WebUI Feature Set

The WebUI implementation provides these core capabilities:

- **Three-Pane Dashboard**: Repository navigation, chronological task feed, and detailed task view with live logs
- **Task Management**: Zero-friction task creation with policy-aware templates and validation
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live session status, logs streaming via SSE, and event-driven updates
- **IDE Integration**: One-click launch helpers for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf pointing to active workspaces
- **Governance Controls**: Multi-tenant RBAC, audit trails, and resource management
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Server-side rendering sidecar for users without JavaScript, ensuring core functionality works universally
- **Local Mode**: Zero-setup single-developer experience with localhost-only binding
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second initial load times and 300ms log latency targets

### Parallel Development Tracks

Multiple development tracks can proceed in parallel once the core infrastructure (W1-W1.5-W2) is established:

- **UI Components Track**: Build reusable SolidJS components for forms, tables, and real-time displays (continues from W3-W4)
- **API Integration Track**: Implement REST service client and SSE event handling (W2-W5)
- **Testing Infrastructure Track**: Develop Playwright E2E test suites and mock server utilities
- **Performance Track**: Optimize bundle size, loading times, and real-time performance
- **Accessibility Track**: Implement ARIA landmarks, keyboard navigation, and screen reader testing

### Approach

- **SolidJS + Tailwind CSS**: Modern reactive framework with utility-first styling for maintainable, performant UIs
- **Node.js SSR Sidecar**: Server-side rendering server that proxies requests to the Rust REST API and handles progressive enhancement for users without JavaScript (see [Server-Side-Rendering-with-SolidJS.md](../Research/Server-Side-Rendering-with-SolidJS.md) for implementation guide)
- **Mock-First Development**: Start with comprehensive mock server implementing [REST-Service.md](REST-Service.md) for isolated development
- **Playwright Testing**: Fully automated E2E testing through pre-scripted scenarios that control both the mock REST server state and UI interactions, enabling deterministic testing of complete user journeys, accessibility compliance, and performance benchmarks
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript; real-time features enhance the experience
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, testable components with clear prop interfaces and TypeScript typing
- **Real-time UX**: SSE-driven updates with optimistic UI patterns for pause/stop/resume actions
- **Security-First**: Input validation, XSS prevention, and secure API communication patterns

### Development Phases (with Parallel Tracks)

- Distributed test coverage across all milestones with CI integration
- Full Playwright E2E test suite covering all user journeys
- Accessibility testing (WCAG AA compliance) with axe-core
- Performance testing and optimization validation
- Visual regression testing for UI consistency
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Local mode for zero-setup single-developer usage
- Deployment guides and performance optimizations

### Next Milestone Priority

**W5. IDE Integration and Launch Helpers** is the next priority milestone, providing seamless one-click IDE launching for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf with platform-specific URL scheme handling.

### Current Outstanding Tasks

Based on W4 completion, here are the remaining tasks for WebUI development:

#### **Test Infrastructure** âœ… **INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE**

- [x] Playwright + Nix browser configuration working
- [x] Test servers start/stop automation
- [x] Basic test framework operational

#### **API Contract Testing** âœ… **COMPLETE**

- [x] All API endpoints working (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE operations)
- [x] Complete mock server implementation with full validation:
  - POST /tasks (session creation with input validation)
  - GET /sessions/:id (session details)
  - POST /sessions/:id/stop (session control)
  - DELETE /sessions/:id (session cancellation)
  - GET /sessions/:id/logs (log streaming)
  - GET /sessions/:id/events (SSE streaming with real-time events)
- [x] Error handling and validation testing
- [x] API proxy middleware correctly forwards requests
- [x] SSE endpoint compatibility with both test requests and real clients

#### **Build Tooling & Quality** âœ… **MOSTLY COMPLETE**

- [x] Projects build successfully
- [ ] Fix TypeScript strict mode compilation errors
- [x] Fix ESLint configuration issues
- [x] Fix Prettier formatting check failures
- [ ] Implement Playwright config validation

#### **Client-Side Application** âœ… **COMPLETED**

- [x] SSR placeholder rendering
- [x] Client-side JavaScript loading and hydration framework
- [x] Client-side JavaScript hydration and routing
- [x] Full SolidJS component rendering
- [x] Interactive UI functionality (basic navigation working)
- [x] Real-time updates via SSE

#### **Accessibility & UX** ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**

- [x] SSR HTML accessibility structure testing (lang, title, noscript, meta tags)
- [ ] WCAG AA compliance testing (requires full client-side content)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation implementation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility (ARIA landmarks, form labels)
- [ ] Color contrast testing (requires full client-side content)
- [ ] Focus indicators and visual accessibility

#### **Integration & Performance** ðŸ“‹ **PENDING**

- [ ] Real API service integration
- [ ] Performance optimization (TTI targets)
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility validation

### Risks & mitigations

- **Framework Maturity**: SolidJS is production-ready but less common than React; mitigated by thorough evaluation and fallback to React if issues arise
- **Real-time Complexity**: SSE implementation requires careful error handling; mitigated by robust reconnection logic and fallback to polling
- **Browser Compatibility**: WebUI targets modern browsers only; mitigated by clear browser support matrix and graceful degradation
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-2s TTI challenging with real-time features; mitigated by code splitting, lazy loading, and performance budgeting
- **Mock vs Real API**: Initial development with mocks risks integration issues; mitigated by mock server implementing full [REST-Service.md](REST-Service.md) spec
