### Milestone Completion & Outstanding Tasks

Each milestone maintains an **outstanding tasks list** that tracks specific deliverables, bugs, and improvements. When milestones are completed, their sections are expanded with:

- Implementation details and architectural decisions
- References to key source files for diving into the implementation
- Test coverage reports and known limitations
- Integration points with other milestones/tracks

### WebUI Feature Set

The WebUI implementation provides these core capabilities (current status in parentheses):

- **Simplified Task-Centric Layout**: Agent Harbor branded header, chronological task feed, and always-visible draft task creation ✅ (HTML structure complete, client-side broken)
- **Task Management**: Zero-friction task creation with TOM's select widgets, model instance counters, and markdown support 🔄 (components implemented, SessionProvider blocking)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live session status, logs streaming via SSE, and event-driven updates with 4-line task cards 🔄 (infrastructure exists, client-side broken)
- **IDE Integration**: One-click launch helpers for VS Code, Cursor, and Windsurf pointing to active workspaces 📋 (not yet implemented)
- **Governance Controls**: Multi-tenant RBAC, audit trails, and resource management 📋 (not yet implemented)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Server-side rendering sidecar for users without JavaScript, ensuring core functionality works universally 🔄 (SSR working, client hydration broken)
- **Dual-Server Architecture**: Clean separation between SSR server (HTML/CSS/JS) and API server (REST endpoints) for simplified development and deployment ✅ (architecture defined, implementation pending)
- **Local Mode**: Zero-setup single-developer experience with localhost-only binding 📋 (not yet implemented)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and contextual keyboard shortcuts 🔄 (HTML structure good, tests failing)
- **Performance**: Sub-2-second initial load times and 300ms log latency targets 📋 (not yet measured)

### Parallel Development Tracks

Multiple development tracks can proceed in parallel once the core infrastructure (W1-W1.5-W2) is established:

- **UI Components Track**: Build reusable SolidJS components for forms, tables, and real-time displays (continues from W3-W4)
- **API Integration Track**: Implement REST service client and SSE event handling (W2-W5)
- **Testing Infrastructure Track**: Develop Playwright E2E test suites and mock server utilities
- **Performance Track**: Optimize bundle size, loading times, and real-time performance
- **Accessibility Track**: Implement ARIA landmarks, keyboard navigation, and screen reader testing

### Approach

- **SolidJS + SolidStart SSR**: Modern reactive framework with server-side rendering, enabling fast initial page loads and progressive enhancement for users without JavaScript
- **Dual-Server Architecture**: SSR server serves HTML/CSS/JS on dedicated port, API server serves REST endpoints on separate port. Client connects directly to API server for data operations.
- **Server-Side Data Fetching**: REST API calls made during SSR to populate initial page content, ensuring full functionality even without JavaScript
- **SolidStart Application Architecture**: Single-page application built with SolidStart's built-in SSR capabilities and client-side hydration (no API proxy middleware needed)
- **Mock-First Development**: Comprehensive mock server ([Mock Server README](../webui/mock-server/README.md)) implementing REST-Service.md for isolated development and testing
- **Vitest Testing**: Unit and integration testing with jsdom environment for DOM testing, cheerio for HTML parsing, and server process spawning for full-stack validation
- **SSR Test Verification**: Automated server-side rendering tests start actual dev server processes, make HTTP requests, and validate HTML content/structure without browser execution
- **Playwright E2E Testing**: Fully automated end-to-end testing through pre-scripted scenarios that control both the mock REST server state and UI interactions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript; real-time features enhance the experience through client-side hydration
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable, testable components with clear prop interfaces, TypeScript typing, and SSR compatibility comprehensive testing)
- **Real-time UX**: SSE-driven updates with optimistic UI patterns for pause/stop/resume actions
- **Security-First**: Input validation, XSS prevention, and secure API communication patterns

### Next Milestone Priority

🟢 **TEST INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE - Ready for Feature Implementation**

**Completed in This Session (Sept 29, 2025):**
1. ✅ **PRD Updated**: Added keyboard navigation, context-sensitive shortcuts, TOM Select integration, SSE requirements
2. ✅ **Test Strategy Document**: Created comprehensive 397-line test strategy covering 100% of PRD requirements
3. ✅ **Mock Server Enhanced**: Now returns exactly 5 sessions (3 completed, 2 active) with realistic SSE event streams
4. ✅ **SSR Data Fetching**: Implemented server-side data fetching for progressive enhancement
5. ✅ **Keyboard Navigation Tests**: Created 25 comprehensive E2E tests for all keyboard interactions
6. ✅ **TOM Select Tests**: Created 33 comprehensive E2E tests for fuzzy-search widgets and multi-select

**Test Coverage Summary:**
- keyboard-navigation.spec.ts: 25 tests (arrow keys, Enter navigation, shortcuts, accessibility)
- tom-select-components.spec.ts: 33 tests (repository/branch/model selectors, fuzzy search, multi-select counters)
- toast-notifications.spec.ts: 5 tests (error toasts, manual dismissal, positioning, ARIA attributes)
- draft-save-status.spec.ts: 5 tests (save status states, timing, ARIA attributes, positioning)
- Total: 68 new E2E tests + existing 14 API contract tests = 82 automated tests

**Next Development Priorities (TDD Approach):**
1. **Implement Keyboard Navigation** - Make keyboard-navigation.spec.ts tests pass (25 tests)
2. **Integrate TOM Select Library** - Make tom-select-components.spec.ts tests pass (33 tests)
3. **W5. IDE Integration and Launch Helpers** - One-click IDE launching for VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf
4. **W6. Governance and Multi-tenancy** - RBAC implementation, tenant/project scoping, admin panels
5. **Performance Optimization** - Sub-2s TTI targets and real-time log latency optimization

**New Architecture Benefits (When Working)**:
- **Simplified UX**: Single-screen task-centric design eliminates navigation complexity
- **Always-Available Creation**: Draft tasks permanently visible reduces friction for task creation
- **TOM's Select Widgets**: Fuzzy search and model counters provide powerful yet simple selection
- **Keyboard-Driven**: Full keyboard navigation with visual hints improves power-user experience
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design works seamlessly across devices
- **Status-at-a-Glance**: 4-line task cards maximize information density without clutter

**Key Technical Achievements (Partial)**:
- **Dual-Server Architecture**: Clean separation between SSR server (HTML/CSS/JS) and API server (REST endpoints), eliminating proxy complexity
- **SSR HTML Structure**: Server-side rendering produces correct semantic HTML with branding and footer
- **Agent Harbor Branding**: Complete rebrand with SVG logo integration and consistent theming (HTML level)
- **Component Architecture**: Clean separation between layout, task cards, and interactive widgets (code structure exists)
- **Vitest Testing**: Comprehensive unit/integration testing with jsdom, cheerio, and server process spawning
- **SSR Test Verification**: Automated HTML validation without browser execution
- **Accessibility HTML**: Proper semantic structure with ARIA landmarks (client-side functionality blocked)

### Current Outstanding Tasks

Based on the major design redesign, the current state requires significant work to align tests and functionality:

#### **🟡 CRITICAL: Server-Side Draft Persistence**

- [x] **COMPLETED**: SSR server displays real session data from mock REST server (via client-side hydration)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: "New Task" button adds empty draft task cards (multiple supported)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Draft task cards have remove buttons and form validation
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Implement server-side draft persistence REST endpoints (`POST /api/v1/drafts`, `GET /api/v1/drafts`, `PUT /api/v1/drafts/{id}`, `DELETE /api/v1/drafts/{id}`)
- [ ] **PENDING**: Update DraftProvider to persist drafts to server instead of local state

### Risks & mitigations

- **Framework Maturity**: SolidJS is production-ready but less common than React; mitigated by thorough evaluation and fallback to React if issues arise
- **Real-time Complexity**: SSE implementation requires careful error handling; mitigated by robust reconnection logic and fallback to polling
- **Browser Compatibility**: WebUI targets modern browsers only; mitigated by clear browser support matrix and graceful degradation
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-2s TTI challenging with real-time features; mitigated by code splitting, lazy loading, and performance budgeting
- **Mock vs Real API**: Initial development with mocks risks integration issues; mitigated by mock server implementing full [REST-Service.md](REST-Service.md) spec
